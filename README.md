A homebrewed **Virtual Newtowork Computing** solution for personal use.

I dont expect or really want anyone to use this project, and i mostly put it up so other people can look through the code if they want to borrow anything from it. 

It is not complete or as fast as other solutions but it was very fun to make :)
